By the time the `setTimeout` callbacks execute (after a minimum delay), the loop has already completed, and `i`'s final value is `3`. All three callbacks reference this same `i` and thus log `3`.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"What is the output of the following code?\",\n      \"options\": [\n        \"1, -1, 2\",\n        \"1, 0, 2\",\n        \"1, -1, 1\",\n        \"1, 1, 2\"\n      ],\n      \"correctAnswer\": 0,\n      \"explanation\": \"Each call to `createCounter()` creates a new closure, meaning `counter1` and `counter2` have their own independent `count` variables. `counter1.increment()` makes its `count` `1`. `counter2.decrement()` makes its `count` `-1`. `counter1.increment()` then makes its `count` `2`.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"What will be logged to the console by the following `async` function?\",\n      \"options\": [\n        \"Data A, Data B, Error C\",\n        \"Data A, Data B, (then nothing else, silent failure)\",\n        \"Data A, Data B, Error C (logged by console.error)\",\n        \"Data A, Data B, undefined\"\n      ],\n      \"correctAnswer\": 2,\n      \"explanation\": \"`p1` resolves immediately, `p2` resolves after 50ms, and `p3` rejects immediately. `await p1` logs 'Data A'. `await p2` logs 'Data B'. When `await p3` is encountered, the promise rejects, throwing an error that is caught by the `try...catch` block. `console.error(error)` then logs 'Error C'.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"What will be logged to the console when `obj.greet()` and `greetFunc()` are called?\",\n      \"options\": [\n        \"Hello, Object, Hello, Object\",\n        \"Hello, Object, Hello, Global\",\n        \"Hello, Object, Hello, undefined\",\n        \"Hello, Object, (throws an error)\"\n      ],\n      \"correctAnswer\": 1,\n      \"explanation\": \"When `obj.greet()` is called, `this` inside `greet` refers to `obj`, so it logs 'Hello, Object'. When `greetFunc()` is called, it's a standalone function call. In non-strict mode (like this example outside of a module context), `this` defaults to the global object (e.g., `window` in browsers), so it logs 'Hello, Global' because `name` is a global variable.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"What will be the output of the following `reduce` operation?\",\n      \"options\": [\n        \"{ evens: [2, 4], odds: [1, 3, 5] }\",\n        \"[2, 4]\",\n        \"[1, 3, 5]\",\n        \"undefined\"\n      ],\n      \"correctAnswer\": 0,\n      \"explanation\": \"The `reduce` method iterates through the `numbers` array.

The `Dog` class then overrides the `speak()` method with its own implementation. Therefore, `myDog.speak()` will call the `Dog`'s `speak()` method, returning 'Buddy barks.'. `myDog.fetch()` calls the method defined exclusively in `Dog`. `myDog instanceof Animal` returns `true` because `Dog` is a subclass of `Animal`.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"What is the correct order of console logs for the following code?\",\n      \"options\": [\n        \"Start, Timeout 1, Promise 1, Promise 2, Timeout 2, End\",\n        \"Start, End, Promise 1, Promise 2, Timeout 1, Timeout 2\",\n        \"Start, Promise 1, End, Timeout 1, Promise 2, Timeout 2\",\n        \"Start, End, Timeout 1, Promise 1, Promise 2, Timeout 2\"\n      ],\n      \"correctAnswer\": 1,\n      \"explanation\": \"The JavaScript event loop prioritizes tasks. First, all synchronous code runs: `Start`, `End`. Then, the microtask queue (Promises) is emptied: `Promise 1`, `Promise 2`.

However, `0 === false` is `false` because strict equality (`===`) checks for both value and type, and `0` is a number while `false` is a boolean, so their types differ.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"question\": \"Consider `math.js` and `app.js` using ES Modules.

The `subtract` function is exported as the *default* export, meaning it can be imported with any local name (e.g., `sub`) using `import sub from './math.js';`. Both imports are correct, and the `console.log` statements will output `8` and `2` respectively.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```"
